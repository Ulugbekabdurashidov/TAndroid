### Submission Checklist

Please **review the following checklist** to ensure your submission is valid:

- [ ] Did you **add a README** which includes a **GIF walkthrough** of the app's functionality?
- [ ] Did you **use our** <a href="https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/mobile_app_design/readme_templates_android/0_pre-work_readme.md?raw=true" alt="**README template**" title="**README template**" target="_blank">**README template**</a> for your README?
- [ ] Does your **GIF render directly in your README?** When using Imgur, you can right-click on the gif and choose "Copy Image Address" to get the correct address. Make sure the address has a `.gif` extension. If you end up with a url that has a `.gifv` extension, removing the `v` and changing this to `.gif` will ensure the gif renders on GitHub.
